     <h2>about me</h2>
    <p>
        I am currently studying at <em>Algonquin</em> College in the Interactive Media Design program, a field that combines creativity with technology. This program allows me to work on a variety of projects that encourage innovative thinking and the development of new digital skills. Through hands-on learning and academic study, I am building a strong foundation to support my future career goals.


    
        Throughout my studies, I continue to expand my knowledge in areas related to digital media and creative problem-solving. I am focused on improving both my technical and design abilities while adapting to new challenges. I am expected to complete this program on February 12<sup>th</sup>, 2026, and I look forward to applying what I have learned in a professional environment.
    </p>
    <p>
    In my daily life, I enjoy exploring creative hobbies that help me relax and grow. For example, I like experimenting with digital art and photography, which allows me to express my ideas visually. I also spend time reading articles and books related to design and technology, keeping myself inspired and motivated to develop new skills.
